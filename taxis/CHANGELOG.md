# Changelog

## 0.1.1

- Entity counts in the header and on the home page now count active entities,
  the way Home Assistant does. Disabled entities are counted separately
  ("1,323 entities (2,962 disabled)").
- Every read of Home Assistant and every error is now written to the app's Log
  tab, with timestamps. Connection errors name the address Taxis tried.

## 0.1.0

- First version: reads floors, areas, devices, entities and labels and shows them
  as a hierarchy, with each area's entities grouped by role. Read-only.
